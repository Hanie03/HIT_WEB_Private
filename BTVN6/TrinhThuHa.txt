<!-- ---------------------OPERATORS--------------------- -->
<!-- 1. Comparison Operators -->
==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>	greater than
<	less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	ternary operator

<!-- 2. Logical Operators -->
&&	 and
||	 or
!	 not

<!-- 3. Bitwise Operators -->
&	AND     
|	OR
~	NOT
^	XOR
<<	left shift
>>	right shift
>>>	unsigned right shift

<!-- 4. Arithmectic Operators -->
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation
/	Division
%	Modulus (Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement

<!-- 5. Assignment Operators -->
=
+=
-=
*=
/=
%=
**=

<!-- 6. Conditional (ternary) operator -->
condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse

- condition: An expression whose value is used as a condition.
- exprIfTrue: An expression which is executed if the condition evaluates to a truthy value (one which equals or can be converted to true).
- exprIfFalse: An expression which is executed if the condition is falsy (that is, has a value which can be converted to false).

<!-- ---------------------LET, CONST, VAR--------------------- -->
var: 
- hoisting
- function scope, global scope
- can be re-declared and updated
- initialized: undefined

let & const: not hoisting
- let is used for variable which can be changed
- const is used for a variable which doesnâ€™t change till the program ends
- block scope, global scope
- not initialized

P/S:
+ function scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and   cannot be used outside that function.
+ global scope: When a variable is declared outside a function, it is global scope, all the other functions and variables are contained in this global scope.
+ block scope: the variables declared inside the curly braces {} are called as within block scope that is they are only accessible within that particular block.

<!-- --------------------- CONDITION STATEMENTS--------------------- -->
<!-- 1. if -->
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
<!-- 2. if...else -->
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

<!-- 3. if..else if...else -->
if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
